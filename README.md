## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project, I was finally able to work with a Figma design file that provided me with detailed information about colors and typography to assist me with developing this web page.

Also, I became a bit more comfortable with CSS Grid: particularly, with the Header section, as well as ensuring that the "Pointers" section remained centered throughout all view widths.

### Continued development

I would love to continue working on future projects that provide you with a Figma design file.

I'm also continuing to become more comfortable with determining rem vs. em units, as well as making web sites more responsive.

### Useful resources

- [Pixels to Em's Conversion Tool](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_pxtoemconversion.asp) - This assisted me with converting from pixels (provided by the Figma design file) to em units
- [PX to REM Conversion Tool](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - Same as the resource that I previously listed
